Project Euler Solutions
=============================================

My solutions for Project Euler.

Some solutions aren't very efficient.

Makefiles and test data are included, when applicable.

Python solutions have been tested using Python 3.4.3 on ubuntu 14.04.

It's possible there may be errors - if you find any I'd be interested to know.
